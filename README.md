# LVU_COMP
#### A tool for identifying potential bias in linked datasets

## This tool is in development and should not be used for the purpose of identifying potential bias

LVU_COMP, or linked versus unlinked comparisons contains two methods for identifying potential bias in linked data. The first tool is lvu_chi2, which compares the distribution of a categorical variable in linked data to its distribution in unlinked data. The second tool is lvu_effect, which looks at the magnitude of the difference between the proportion of a particular level of a categorical variable (relative to the total across all levels) in true matches compared to false or missed matches. These two methods are described in more detail below.
